In the original dataset we mainly used the image from "preprocessed_image" folder,
but since some image file name is missing (that was listed in full_df.csv) we look
for the missing image in the ODIR-5k folder and combine the 2 folder inside it
(it was split into train and validation but the dataset was meant for ocular disease)
in a new folder called "image_data".
